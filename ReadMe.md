# Task Reminder App

You should design a home screen with a list of reminders and a screen to take user input about his reminders. Below you can find a clear explanation of how the flow of the application should be:

1. Showing Reminders using FlatList.
2. Embedding a floating action button on the home screen. Using this, the user can add new tasks.
3. Adding reminders to Async Storage.
4. Setting the alarm Using Alarm Manager and Notification.
5. Show Notification when the alarm triggers.
